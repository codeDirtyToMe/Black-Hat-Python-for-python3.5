# Black-Hat-Python-for-python3.5
Redoing all the code examples from the Black Hat Python book in python 3.5.

I noticed a lot of people complaining about the example programs in Black Hat Python not working in python 3+
I've decided to go ahead and covert them to 3.5 as I make my way through the book.

Liberties are being taken with certain conventions as I see fit, so some of the code may not seem all that
familiar, but i do indend for all examples to function exactly the same as the book. These differences will
be most obvious in the naming of variables and functions as I prefer camelCase. 

Argument parsing is also very different.
