# Black-Hat-Python-for-python3.5
Redoing all the code examples from the Black Hat Python book in python 3.5.

I noticed a lot of people complaining about the example programs in Black Hat Python not working in python 3+
I've decided to go ahead and covert them to 3.5 as I make my way through the book.
